# Presentations

These are some of the presentations that I have been working on.

I'm planning on serving them with GitHub Pages, for now, only the
source code will be available here.

The presentations are done using the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)
framework.

Each presentation will be a branch of this main branch, so you can freely
browse them at any time.
